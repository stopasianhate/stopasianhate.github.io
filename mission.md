### Our Mission

The Asian Care Fund was created on March 18th, a day after the tragic mass shooting in Georgia. We condemn the horrific acts of hate and violence targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, and we took actions. We want  to track and report every Asian hate crimes, promote awareness of racism against the AAPI community, and provide resources for people to stay safe during and after the pandemic.
