The Stop Asian Hate Crime project was created on March 18th, a day after the tragic mass shooting in Georgia. We condemn the horrific acts of hate and violence targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, and we took actions. We want this website to track and report every Asian hate crimes, promote awareness of racism against the AAPI community, and provide resources for people to stay safe during and after the pandemic.


This website and the associated dataset will continue to be updated by our volunteers indefinitely. Join us by texting to (+1) 226-220-4030.
